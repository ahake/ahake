### Welcome to my Github ðŸ‘‹

I'm a hobby coder with some experience in C#, Basic, Python and Assembler, as well as a few others.

Ok, let's do this while the trend is hot:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Nonogram solver in C#
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust, Java, JS
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about document workflows
- âš¡ Fun fact: Polyglot in both programming in human languages
